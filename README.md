# Overview

The platform I’m designing requires authentication for Users and Clients (often IoT devices but also other APIs/services), whilst authentication is an interesting challenge to save time we’ll integrate Auth0 as a centralised platform.

However, we don’t want to become dependent on Auth0 for authentication so this document should outline our approach to avoiding that and using Auth0 to our potential across our platform.
